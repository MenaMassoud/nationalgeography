Is our little corner of the galaxy a special place? As of this date, we’ve discovered more than 1,500 exoplanets: planets orbiting stars other than our sun. Thousands more will be added to the list in the coming years as we confirm planetary candidates by alternative, independent methods.In the hunt for other planets, we’re especially interested in those that might potentially host life. 
            So we focus our modern exoplanet surveys on planets that might be similar to Earth: low-mass, rocky and with just the right temperature to allow for liquid water. But what about the other planets in the solar system? The Copernican principle – the idea that the Earth and the solar system are not unique or special in the universe – suggests the architecture of our planetary system should be common. But it doesn’t seem to be.

The figure Planets like Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus occupy “empty” parts of the diagram – we haven’t found other planets with similar masses and orbits so far. At face value, this would indicate that the majority of planetary systems do not resemble our own solar system.

        <p>
            A powerful lightsaber slices through the dark clouds of dust and gas that surround it. It's not a scene from the new "Star Wars" movie but an image captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.

Formed by material falling onto a newborn star, the two beams of light shoot outward from their star at supersonic speeds to create the two jets that look like the double-sided lightsaber wielded by Darth Maul in "Star Wars: Episode The Phantom Menace." 
      Collapsing clouds of dust and gas create new stars as they fall inward. Cloaked by dust and gas, the protostar grows massive enough to harness its power and begin the fusion process. In some cases, the material streaming onto the young star erupts into fiery jets that burst from the stellar poles. As the powerful jets collide with surrounding material, they create curved shock waves at their ends. These create tangled, knotted clumps of material called Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, according to a statement from the European Space Agency (ESA). The HH object in the new Hubble image around the young star is known as HH 24.These supersonic shock fronts then heat the surrounding gas to thousands of degrees Fahrenheit, ESA officials say.  </p></div>

        <p>
            Meteoroid showers help create the moon's exosphere, its wispy version of an atmosphere, a new study suggests.

The moon's atmosphere consists entirely of a tenuous layer called an exosphere, where the density of gases is only about one-trillionth that of Earth's atmosphere at sea level, according to the authors of the new study. The molecules are so thinly spread apart that they almost never hit one another. Earth also has an exosphere, but it begins about 300 miles (500 kilometers) above the planet's surface, while the moon's exosphere starts at its surface.
             Although the moon's exosphere is thin, its interaction with the lunar surface is critical to understanding the evolution and history of the moon, "as well as other bodies with surface-bound exospheres, such as Mercury, asteroids and the moons of Mars," Anthony Colaprete, the study's lead author and a planetary atmospheric scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, told Space.com in an email.To learn more about how the moon's exosphere interacts with its surface, researchers focused on sodium and potassium. These elements are only trace ingredients of the lunar exosphere, but they emit  enough light to make them the easiest of the exosphere's constituents to detect with scientific instruments.

Previous data on sodium and potassium in the moon's exosphere was sporadic and limited, the study authors said. By analyzing new data from the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission, the scientists were able to consistently monitor changes in the lunar exosphere's sodium and potassium levels over the course of several months.  </p></div>

        <p>
           Pluto's complex geology just got a little less mysterious thanks to two incredible new photos from NASA's New Horizons spacecraft.

The probe flew by Pluto on July 14, taking detailed photos and measurements of the dwarf planet as it passed and transmitting them back to Earth.

The first new photo, released by NASA last week, spans a region 50 miles (80 kilometers) wide and combines two of the sharpest images yet from New Horizons into a breathtaking, colorized close-up of the dwarf planet's terrain. The al-Idrisi mountains, made of water ice — some of which stand more than 1.5 miles (2.4 km) high — fill the top of the frame. The smooth, icy plane of Pluto's heart, informally named Tombaugh Regio, sweeps in from the lower-right corner.
            Scientists created the colorized image using a set of photos taken by New Horizons over the course of its closest approach to Pluto during the flyby. The base photo is a black-and-white high-resolution (about 250 to 280 feet, or 77 to 85 meters, per pixel) image taken by the spacecraft's telescopic Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) 15 minutes before the spacecraft reached its destination. The photo reveals features smaller than half a city block on Pluto's surface.

That image was later combined with low-resolution (about 2,066 feet, or 630 m, per pixel) color data taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera 25 minutes prior to the LORRI pictures, NASA officials said in a statement.
